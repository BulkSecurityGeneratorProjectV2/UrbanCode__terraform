<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<context
xmlns="com.urbancode.terraform.tasks.vcloud">
    <environment 
    name="my-vcloud-env"
    vdc-name="My VDC1">
        <v-app name="test vApp"
	template-name="my_test_template"
	catalog-name="catalog1"
	description="this is a description of my vApp">
