Basic Installation
===================
 	You will find a shell script in terraform/bin. This is used
 to run Terraform. 

How to run terraform: 
 terraform [create/destory] [input-xml-file] [input-credentials-file]
 
 Include any key-pair (.pem) files from Amazon in ~/.terraform



VMware
===================
 ( include vmware notes here )



Amazon Web Services 
===================

	In order for any Post Create Actions to run on an Amazon EC2 
instance, the instance must have an Elastic Ip Address assigned 
to it. You must also have the key-pair (ssh key) that the instance 
was created with in your ~/.terraform directory. 

	The Elastic Ip Address is neccessary since the instances are 
launched inside of a Virtual Private Cloud. The EIP allows you to 
communicate with those instances from outside of the VPC.
File Information

	The key-pair file is needed for connecting to the server. You
must also know what user that key-pair was associated with. This is 
determined when the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is created.
